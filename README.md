# Meerkat

This is Meercat, a friendly formatter for Suricata rules, written mostly after a heavy night of partying/drinking and a night shift one after another.

## Features

You get a suricata rule formatter for free, so that should be a plus!

## Requirements

Not that I am aware of.

## Extension Settings

Please look at the `package.json` file.

## Known Issues

Meercat always works correctly on my PC, so if you have a known issue, please keep it to yourself.
